	<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			I am a User Experience Designer and Researcher. Before moving to the NYC area I lived in Washington DC for nearly a decade. I’ve worked at large corporations and small startups, across varying industries from hospitality and broadcast media to financial services and healthcare. Agile, qualitative research is my stealth skill. I am a proud Midwesterner although I unapologetically use the term “soda” rather than “pop.”<br>
			I have never met a breakfast sandwich I didn’t like.
